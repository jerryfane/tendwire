# Release checklist (Tendwire source-only RC)

Build release artifacts from a **clean git checkout only**. Never zip the working
directory directly — it can contain `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.pytest_cache/`,
local `*.db` state, `installation.key`, `installation.key.sha256`, or
`installation.key.initialized`, none of which may ship. `.gitignore` excludes
these local-state filenames, so building from tracked content is what
guarantees a clean artifact.

## 1. Preconditions

```sh
git status --porcelain            # must be empty
python -m py_compile $(find src tests -name '*.py')
python -m pytest -q               # all green
```

## 2. Build a clean artifact

Source zip/tar (tracked files only, respects `.gitignore`):

```sh
git archive --format=zip -o dist/tendwire-$(git describe --always).zip HEAD
```

Or a Python sdist/wheel (hatchling; packages `src/tendwire` + declared includes):

```sh
python -m build
```

## 3. Verify the artifact is clean

The following must print nothing:

```sh
git archive --format=tar HEAD | tar -t | grep -E '__pycache__|\.pyc$|\.pytest_cache|\.db$|(^|/)installation\.key(\.sha256|\.initialized)?$'
```

For sdist/wheel:

```sh
tar -tf dist/*.tar.gz | grep -E '__pycache__|\.pyc$|\.pytest_cache|\.db$|(^|/)installation\.key(\.sha256|\.initialized)?$' || echo clean
```

## 4. Coherent backup and continuity verification

Before an ordinary Tendwire/Herdres upgrade:

1. Stop Herdres, Tendwire, and every other identity consumer. Capture one
   access-restricted recovery set containing the active Tendwire database,
   `data_dir/installation.key`, `data_dir/installation.key.sha256`,
   `data_dir/installation.key.initialized`, and complete Herdres persistent
   state. The three identity artifacts and all dependent state must come from
   the same stopped-service checkpoint.
2. Confirm the Tendwire data directory is mode `0700`, all three identity files
   are mode `0600`, and the files are owned by the Tendwire service account.
   Confirm that `installation.key.initialized` is the exact nonsecret one-byte
   value `1` and that the release artifact contains none of the three
   filenames.
3. Retain all three identity artifacts through the upgrade. Start Tendwire
   before Herdres and confirm a known same-workspace worker has the same
   exact-format `meta.stable_key` and integer `stable_key_version: 1` as before.
   Then start Herdres and confirm its existing binding/topic remains singular.
4. Verify a same-workspace tab move preserves the handle and a controlled
   cross-workspace move changes it. Also verify a fixture restore preserves the
   handle while terminal/session identifiers change; those volatile identifiers
   are not continuity inputs.

Ordinary load validates and reuses initialized state and never rotates it. With
`installation.key.initialized` present, loss of the key, digest, or both fails
closed; stop every identity consumer and restore the complete coherent recovery
set rather than repairing individual artifacts. The sentinel is created only
after Tendwire has validated and published the key and digest.

Deliberate offline rotation is not release continuity verification. With
Tendwire and every identity consumer stopped, invoke
`tendwire.worker_identity.reset_installation_key(Path(data_dir),
acknowledge_continuity_break=True)` through a controlled operator Python
environment; never delete identity files manually. The next eligible load
bootstraps a new three-artifact identity and changes every `wsk1_` handle.
Herdres state, bindings, and topics require explicit migration and review;
stale bindings are quarantined and old topics are not silently rebound or
automatically reused.

## 5. Goal 07/09 ingestion and pending verification

The release contract uses store schema v10. Its transactional v8-to-v9
migration backfills immutable positive `list_sequence` values independently per
host and creates the uniqueness/paging state used by stable `turn.list`
traversal. The v9-to-v10 migration preserves public pending rows while adding
explicit freshness, binding-scoped revision routing, and durable two-phase
answer claims; migrated rows remain unanswerable until refreshed from an
authoritative binding.
Validate a migration only on the access-restricted scratch copy from section 4;
do not initialize or migrate the sole recovery copy.

The daemon owns short-cadence and event-signaled refresh, with coalescing,
per-target serialization, a fixed worker/queue bound, adapter deadlines, and
aggregate degraded/stale health. Public read handlers remain cache-only.

OMP cache/IPC state must remain a coordinate-only checkpoint and must never
carry prompt, user, final, or stream bodies. An unchanged stable stat must
return unchanged without spawn/read/transport; changed open turns reconstruct
from a replay coordinate; completed finals compact to idle EOF until a new
eligible user message opens a turn. The private cache remains bounded by 64
entries and 64 KiB serialized key-plus-checkpoint weight, with disappeared
bindings pruned and same-path private-fingerprint changes advancing its
generation.

The OMP spawned-reader request remains capped at 16 KiB. A canonical OMP
response has no total-size ceiling: its exact ordered payload is streamed in
frames of at most 1 MiB under the same deadline, with manifest, nonce,
end-marker, and EOF validation, so canonical finals are not truncated by IPC.
Nonblocking framed socket send/receive, parsing, and join share that adapter
deadline without a helper IPC thread.
Timeout teardown spends at most 250 ms on terminate/kill/join attempts and
reaps the child under normal POSIX scheduling; it does not wait beyond that
grace for an OS-uninterruptible child. A
content-bearing file-reader candidate publishes only after exact binding
revalidation and successful durable apply; a no-content candidate still
requires binding validation. Cancellation, failure, stale binding, or a changed
same-path generation cannot advance the cache. Ingestion health must recover
after a later success while preserving cumulative failed/timeout counters;
`stale_binding` churn must not by itself keep health degraded.

Daemon and CLI pending surfaces must share the atomic latest-snapshot plus
durable-`backend_pending` store projection. A malformed snapshot fails as
`store_unavailable`. Definite pre-transmission daemon unavailability permits
only a store read and no Herdr observation. A post-transmission timeout returns
`daemon_timeout`; protocol ambiguity returns `daemon_protocol_error`, and
neither path falls back.

`tendwire turns` direct refresh fallback is limited to one initial-page attempt
when daemon unavailability is definite before request transmission; a timeout
after transmission returns `daemon_timeout` without a second refresh.
Pagination remains bounded to limit 100 by default and 250 maximum, uses stable
watermark-bound cursor/since traversal with a fixed 900-second cursor TTL, and
retains the 1 MiB transport-frame and 48 KiB content-page limits. The API keeps
eight request workers and 32 admitted connections, returning retryable
`server_busy` beyond that bound. Release-visible ingestion metrics must remain
aggregate and must not expose a worker, target, session path, or private
fingerprint.

From the source checkout, run the focused Goal 07 suite:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pytest -q \
  tests/test_turn_ingestion.py tests/test_herdr_events.py tests/test_daemon.py \
  tests/test_cli.py tests/test_cli_command.py tests/test_store.py \
  tests/test_herdr_turns.py tests/test_turns.py tests/test_config.py \
  tests/test_public_content_safety.py
```

Then run the complete suite:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pytest -q
```

Run the frozen benchmark command exactly:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 scripts/turn_ingestion_benchmark.py \
  --workers 8 --blocked-workers 2 --blocked-seconds 5 \
  --warmups 3 --samples 21 --json
```

The benchmark must use generated private fixtures and real Unix-socket requests
with two deterministically blocked adapters, never live state. Record only its
aggregate public-safe output in
`docs/evidence/goal07-turn-ingestion-benchmark.md`. The recorded-host evidence
budgets are cached `turn.list` and `health.get` p95 no greater than 350 ms and
immediate synthetic `command.submit` p95 no greater than 250 ms. These are
recorded-host release evidence rather than ordinary-CI or unit-test timing
gates, and not a generic SLA, scaling guarantee, or statistical service-level
claim. Do not state observed timing or deployment success until the completed
evidence supports it.

## 6. Goal 08 Codex session-reader verification

A Codex binding must be an exact canonical lowercase, non-nil UUID. The only
eligible rollout grammar is
`sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-<uuid>.jsonl`, with a valid
date/time matching the hierarchy and no identifier interpolation into a glob.
Resolution must yield exactly one canonical regular file beneath the canonical
sessions root after symlink and device/inode checks. Missing, unsafe,
over-limit, or multiple exact matches are unavailable.
Every cache hit validates the current sessions-root device/inode; a found result
also validates the rollout inode. A root identity change immediately clears
that root's cached path results and complete index.

The complete index is bounded to 100,000 filesystem visits, 32,768 session
identities, and 8 MiB retained; its path-result LRU is bounded to 256 entries
and 256 KiB. Negative results expire after 2 seconds. A lookup rebuilds the
complete index once its snapshot is 60 seconds old. That interval is the
documented bounded-work tradeoff: a duplicate created after a successful lookup
may remain undiscovered for up to one 60-second snapshot interval, after which
the refreshed index makes the identity ambiguous and unavailable.

The private parser LRU is bounded to 64 entries and 16 MiB. Only valid
newline-terminated records advance the committed offset; a partial final record
waits for its newline. The limits are 8 MiB per record, a 64 KiB initial and
16 MiB maximum/65,536-record recovery scan, and 64 MiB of source data per poll.
Warm append-only reads consume only appended bytes and an unchanged poll reads
zero source bytes. Truncation, rotation, replacement, or missing state uses the
same bounded recovery rather than a whole-file fallback; malformed/oversized
input or no recoverable boundary fails without advancing the prior checkpoint.

Codex parser-state requests are capped at 12 MiB, and each Codex response
remains one frame capped at 64 MiB. A response is only a candidate: content
publishes only after exact binding revalidation and durable apply, and
no-content state still requires binding revalidation. Cancellation, failure,
or a stale/replaced binding cannot advance the cache.
Public JSON must contain no session ID, rollout path,
device/inode, offset, parser/cache state, raw record, or private fingerprint.

Run the focused Goal 08 suite from the source checkout:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pytest -q \
  tests/test_codex_session_reader.py tests/test_herdr_turns.py \
  tests/test_turn_ingestion.py tests/test_public_content_safety.py
```

Then run the complete suite:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pytest -q
```

Run the exact synthetic benchmark command:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 scripts/codex_session_reader_benchmark.py --json
```

The benchmark must use only generated private fixtures, never live Codex state.
Its portable bounded-work gates are: invalid wildcard rejection before any
index build; one complete 20,000-file index build with no more than 100,000
filesystem visits and 8 MiB retained; no extra warm-lookup index build; no more
than 64 KiB read for the benchmark cold resynchronization; exactly append-sized
incremental work; and zero source bytes for an unchanged poll. Its recursive
privacy gate must reject generated paths, session/turn identities, content,
filenames, and UUID-shaped strings from the success report.

Record the exact command and compact aggregate result in
`docs/evidence/goal08-codex-session-reader-benchmark.md`. Documented-host timing
ceilings are release evidence, not ordinary-CI gates, a generic SLA, or a
scaling guarantee.

## 7. Goal 08B SQLite sidecar race/recovery verification

A file-backed store release must treat the main database, `-wal`, `-shm`, and
`-journal` as one identity-validated family. Absent optional sidecars and
optional sidecars that transiently disappear are valid. Once selected, the main
database is mandatory. A wrong type, wrong owner, insecure validation-time
mode, hostile appearance, or identity replacement must fail closed without
following or mutating the entry.

Creation and repair authority must remain explicit and narrow. Prepare may
create only a missing main database and may intersect modes of validated
present family members with `0600`; repair only intersects modes of validated
existing members. Neither creates an optional sidecar, widens a stricter mode,
replaces an entry, or changes ownership. Ordinary reads, diagnostics, health,
and `store status` are validation-only and non-creating. The capture/preflight/
final-validation sequence is bounded and does not recursively retry churn.
Private-mode preparation and repair cannot disturb active Tendwire SQLite
transactions, and a no-op private prepare preserves them. Any main creation or
permission narrowing first requires bounded, nonblocking exclusive authority over
the store parent directory. Current-schema filesystem reads stay cheap and
nonmutating after their schema-version read: they take no exclusive parent
authority and perform no persistent WAL negotiation or schema DDL. An
uninitialized or migrating filesystem store takes that exclusive authority before
persistent WAL negotiation or schema DDL, performs that work under private
creation mode, then revalidates and narrows the resulting main database, `-wal`,
and `-shm` members before restoring retained shared authority. A live Tendwire
connection retains shared parent-directory authority, so a conflicting repair
fails with a typed, path-free error before mutation; that shared authority also
rejects the schema branch before WAL, DDL, or sidecar mutation. A connection
obtains shared authority before preparation, promotes the same authority only for
a necessary mutation, and restores shared authority for the remainder of its lifetime.

Private failures remain typed, path-free `LocalStateError` values; public
surfaces emit fixed aggregate records such as `database_permissions: unsafe`
and `store_unavailable`, without private paths, suffixes, ownership, inode, raw
exception, or content.

Automatic maintenance retains only bounded batch/cadence authority and never
compacts. Dry-run compaction remains validation-only. Execute compaction alone
has explicit offline replacement authority after `--acknowledge-offline`, and
must revalidate the selected source identity before publishing a verified
replacement.

Run these Goal 08B release commands from the isolated candidate source checkout,
never against live configuration, a live database, a live daemon socket, or a
running Tendwire/Herdres service. These are verification commands, not
deployment, migration, or restart instructions.

Focused:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pytest -q \
  tests/test_local_state_permissions.py tests/test_store.py \
  tests/test_diagnostics.py tests/test_cli.py tests/test_daemon.py \

```

Full:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pytest -q
```

Compile:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m py_compile $(git ls-files '*.py')
```

Diff hygiene:

```sh
git diff --check
```

Synthetic installed-candidate evidence:

```sh
python3 scripts/sqlite_sidecar_race_benchmark.py \
  --iterations 128 \
  --daemon-wal-cycles 64 \
  --requests-per-method 64 \
  --herdres-sync-passes 3 \
  --phase-timeout-seconds 120 \
  --json
```

The driver is `scripts/sqlite_sidecar_race_benchmark.py`, its focused harness
test is `tests/test_sqlite_sidecar_race_benchmark.py`, and the frozen compact
aggregate JSON plus exact execution record is
`docs/evidence/goal08b-sqlite-sidecar-race-recovery.md`. Its captured aggregate
records a private temporary directory, installed-candidate import/origin checks,
production callback and Herdres source-sync markers, and exact file-descriptor,
thread, direct-child, and socket accounting. It records one settling sync
followed by exactly two no-op syncs, zero direct Herdr calls, and zero outbound
network attempts. The aggregate does not establish the absence of every possible
access to operator live configuration, database, socket, or service lifecycle;
run the command only under the isolated-candidate directions above.

The driver removes `PYTHONPATH`, deterministically builds a versioned wheel from
this isolated source checkout, installs it with `pip --no-index --no-deps` into
a private temporary virtual environment, and re-executes the candidate with
isolated Python. It verifies that the imported package originates in that
private installation and not the mutable `/home/smith/tendwire` checkout.
Provenance binds base revision
`c0ebff7cfba401f6c13da1b58a00abf8ff0b5f36` to packaged-source SHA-256
`15b1ca262f6051b191d1587d353c465cc74fd6c6a9d0676eb9348eafef35ff87`;
the installed `0.1.0` wheel SHA-256 is
`7be0f975b0241aaf092a9bba38ace2e3e2efd2f91996f02b2cbcb24b93fac02d`.

The frozen run exited `0` with 256 bounded family preparations, 384 scheduled
optional disappearances, 64 daemon WAL cycles, 64 successful requests for each
of `snapshot.get`, schema-v2 `turn.list`, and `health.get`, three Herdres source
passes, exactly two subsequent no-op passes, nine real candidate CLI
subprocesses, zero direct Herdr calls, and zero outbound network attempts.
Candidate resources were file descriptors `3/10/3`, threads `1/11/1`, and
direct children `0/1/0` (before/peak/after); the socket was absent after
shutdown and every frozen Boolean check passed. The evidence document is the
authority for the compact JSON and recorded-host timings; those timings are
observations, not portable CI gates or service-level claims.

## 8. Local hygiene (optional, before building from a dirty tree)

```sh
find . -type d -name __pycache__ -not -path './.git/*' -exec rm -rf {} +
rm -rf .pytest_cache
find . -name '*.pyc' -not -path './.git/*' -delete
```

## Notes

- `HANDOFF.md`, `*.db`, `installation.key`, `installation.key.sha256`, and
  `installation.key.initialized` are git-ignored and never appear in
  `git archive`.
- The public contract shipped is `command.submit` (`tendwire command --json`);
  see the README "Send transport" section. No `pane_id`/`send_keys` is exposed.
- `tests/test_release_readiness.py` guards the public JSON contract (zero
  forbidden keys, no pseudo pane ids).
